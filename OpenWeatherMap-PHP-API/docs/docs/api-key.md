title: API Key
---

All requests require a free API key (sometimes called "APPID") from OpenWeaterMap.
To retrieve your API key, [sign up for an OpenWeatherMap account](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).

After you received your API key, **it might take a ["couple of hours"](https://openweathermap.org/appid) for it to be activated! Other users [reported](https://github.com/cmfcmf/OpenWeatherMap-PHP-API/issues/46) that it took about 10 minutes** until the API key worked.

Please also take note of the license OpenWeatherMap provides the data under. At the time of
writing, all data is licensed under the **CC BY-SA 4.0**, even for paid accounts. However,
remember that this project is not affiliated with OpenWeatherMap, this information may be
outdated and I can't give you legal advice. Make sure to check on the terms and conditions
yourself:

*If something with your API key or account does not work as expected,
please [contact OpenWeatherMap directly](https://openweathermap.force.com/s/contactsupport)
instead of opening an issue, since I most likely cannot help you with your account.*
